# Boldr-DX

Boldr Developer Experience is a build toolkit. If you happen to find Webpack configuration tedious, BoldrDX is for you. BoldrDX uses Webpack in a tailored environment specifically for Boldr. However, you can use it in any project without any troubles.


### Quick Setup

Everything is already setup for you if you created a Boldr project with the CLI. Want all the power without BoldrCMS?

Don't fret it's easy. The steps below will also work in an existing project after a few additional tweaks.

1. `npm init -y`

Add Boldr-DX to your dependencies.  

2. `yarn add --dev boldr-dx`  

Create the **SMALL** configuration files. You won't have to configure too much. Promise. Here are the configs the Boldr base project uses [boldr.config.js](https://github.com/boldr/getBoldr/blob/master/packages/boldr-base-project/.boldr/boldr.config.js) and [dllConfig.js](https://github.com/boldr/getBoldr/blob/master/packages/boldr-base-project/.boldr/dllConfig.js)  

3. `mkdir .boldr && touch boldr.config.js dllConfig.js`

Start the development process.
4. `yarn run dev`
